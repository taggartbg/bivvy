Bivvy describes a development process to shape and implement change requests.
Read the bivvy file only if necessary.
When the user requests to a new Climb or Bivvy, read the document and follow the process.
Before reading the document, tell the user you are "/|\ Gearing up to begin a Climb" (bivvy uses mountaineering metaphors)
If the user asks to start a new PRD or a new feature, confirm the user wants to follow the bivvy process.
